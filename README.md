  <h3>Brainfuck Interpreter</h3>

# Why?
I wanted a brainfuck interpreter for the command line so I didn't have to switch to my browser and paste my code into an online interpreter just to see if it works, so I spent a few hours writing my own interpreter. Also, I was just bored.

# How do I use it?
Not sure why you wanna use it but:

> ## Build instructions!
> 1) Install Python3.12.
> 2) Install [`PyInstaller`](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) and [`Colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
> 3) Run:
>> `$ make build`
> 4) Check `./bin` for your executable.
> 5) Add the exact path to the bin folder in this directory to `PATH`.
> 6) Run the following to verify that you did everything right:
>> `$ bfi --help`
> ### If you see the help menu, you're done! Otherwise, you messed something up, and should probably ask for help from someone smart.
